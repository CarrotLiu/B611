## The Little Prince's Dandelion

- [Live Site](https://carrotliu.github.io/B611/).

### Description

Inspired by the famous fantasy The Little Prince, the website lets every user grow their own dandelion as a little prince on B611, a star neighboring B612. It encourages users to manage their desires and self-identity, reducing anxiety and emptiness in an increasingly competitive world.
The dandelion's core stands for user’s current self and stores the characteristics users currently possess, while the seeds represent user’s desired self and store the characteristics they wish they had. If there’re too much desired characteristics, the dandelion cannot hold the weight and the seeds will fly away, deleting all the data and forcing users to rethink and reduce their desires.
The little prince avatar is user’s consciousness, whose hair glows with the core’s color if there’s one or more ideal qualities not achieved, and with rainbow color if all ideal qualities are achieved (in other word, the current self is the ideal self).
On B611, users can also wander around and see other little princes, make friend with them, and listen to their dandelions (read the seeds and core). Or they can choose to be strangers with each other, and the dandelion will shy away from a stranger’s touch. Users can leave at any time and might never come back. Upon leaving, user's dandelion, along with the data, will also be deleted.

Two main messages:

1. We may have someone accompany us as lover, friends, or family for a period of time. But no one, for most of the time, can accompany us from birth to death. The only one that is with us throughout our life journey is our "dandelion", or our "self". We need to understand the "self", care for it, and tame it, just like the little prince taming his rose.
2. It is ok to never become the ideal “self”. It is ok to not have an ideal self, and be satisfied with who we are now. And it is ok to have a new ideal “self” at some point. No matter what, we shall be able to sit down, look up into the sky, and enjoy the world as it is.

The project implements p5 vertex animation, OOP programming, and web socket techniques, and is partially developed as the Creative Coding Lab Tutorial for CCLab. The number for flying speed of the dandelion is borrowed from my midterm project in CCLab Spring 2021
