## The Little Prince's Dandelion
- [Live Site](https://carrotliu.github.io/B611/).
### Description
Inspired by the famous fantasy The Little Prince, the website lets every user grow their own dandelion as a little prince. The dandelion's core stores the characteristics users currently have, while the seeds represent the characteristics they wish they had. The project encourages users to manage their desires and self-identity, reducing anxiety and emptiness in an increasingly competitive world.
